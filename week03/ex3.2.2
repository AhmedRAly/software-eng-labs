# Exercise 3.2.2

# Question a: What does the script below do?

# The script will take the first command, which is the first set of characters
# so "ls" and it will execute it

# So if I run "./di ls -l", it will only execute "ls" (not "ls -l")
# because the "-l" part gets ignored because the script only uses $1, and "-l" is $2

#So if I want to run the full command I can either change the "$1" to " "$@" " or "$1 $2"
#doing this will let us run  "./di ls -l" the whole command, not only "ls"


# Question b: What does the sequence of commands send to stdout?

# Initial guess: a 1 a1C 1*10
# $A and $B are alone so its simple strings getting printed, then since there is ${B} next to the $A
# It will print both the seperate variables next to eachother, but then there a C next
# to it so that will print as a "C" because there is {} around the B 
# For D will be $B*10 so "1*10", rhis is becasue "*" is not possible to be a variable name
# So bash doesnt recognize the B*10 as a variable , and it wont do math, so its just seen as a string

# The actual output is: a 1 a1C 1*10
# So My guess was correct
